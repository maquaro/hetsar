Description: Estimation and inference of heterogeneous spatial autoregressive
    (HSAR) panel data models. These are models where the spatial lag
    coefficients are allowed to differ over the cross-section units, in
    addition to the fixed effects generally allowed for in the literature. The
    model also features weakly exogenous regressors, such as lagged values of
    the dependent variable and heteroskedastic error. See M. Aquaro, N. Bailey
    and M. H. Pesaran (2021). "Estimation and inference for spatial models with
    heterogeneous coefficients: An application to US house prices". Journal of
    Applied Econometrics 36(1): 18-44. doi:https://doi.org/10.1002/jae.2792
